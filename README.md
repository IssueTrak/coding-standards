Coding Standards
================

These are the general coding standards for IssueTrak Projects and any other resources which may be helpful in that respect.

Currently they fall into 4 categories:

1. [ASP Coding Standards](asp_coding_standards.md)
2. [C\# Coding Standards](csharp_coding_standards.md)
3. [HTML5/CSS3](html_css_coding_standards.md)
4. [JavaScript Coding Standards](javascript_coding_standards.md)


## Installation

Installation is as easy as checking out the repository to the correct location
