* Solution folders should match physical folders on disk.

* Names of projects should derive from the path of the project, relative to the repository root, and starting with "Issuetrak.".

* Names of folders, projects and namespaces should contain only alphabetical and "dot" (.) characters.

* If a folder contains only a project of the same name as the folder, then the folder is unnecessary, the project should be moved up one directory, and the folder should be discarded.
